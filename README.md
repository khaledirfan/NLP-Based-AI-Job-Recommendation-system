 This is a work in progress. Basically, it takes as input a CV pdf file. It checks for certain keywords being present in the CV, and predicts three most applicable job categories for the owner of the CV. It uses the Random Forest Classifier model, which was chosen after comparing performances with 8 other machine learning models.
